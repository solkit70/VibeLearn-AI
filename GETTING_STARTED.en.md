## 🎯 What is VibeLearn AI?

**VibeLearn AI** is a learning methodology for systematically learning new technologies with AI and turning the outputs generated in the process into high-quality "textbooks" that other learners can use.

**Core Philosophy**:
> "Learn with AI, structure what you've learned, and pave the way for the next learner."

---

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 0: Before You Begin

**Files included in the VibeLearn AI_v2.0 folder**:
```
VibeLearn AI_v2.0/
├── README.en.md                     # Introduction to the VibeLearn AI methodology (Recommended to read first!)
├── GETTING_STARTED.en.md           # This file - Quick Start Guide
└── templates/
    ├── topic_starter.en.md         # Topic start template
    ├── roadmap_prompt_template.en.md # Roadmap generation template
    └── daily_learning_prompt.en.md   # Daily learning prompt
```

**💡 Recommended Order**:
1.  **Read README.en.md first** - Understand the philosophy and overall structure of the VibeLearn AI methodology.
2.  **Practice with this guide (GETTING_STARTED.en.md)** - Follow the steps to start learning.

#### 📦 Additional Setup After Cloning This Repo

> If you cloned this repository from GitHub, run the following setup once.
> If you simply downloaded the template files, you can skip this section.

**1. Install the Pre-commit Hook** (once after cloning)

Automatically syncs system prompt files (CLAUDE.md, etc.) and runs quality validation on every `git commit`.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install-hooks.ps1
```

**2. Install Python Dependencies**

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Set Your Claude API Key** (optional — enables auto-translation of CLAUDE.md)

When set, any changes to `CLAUDE.md` are automatically translated into `CLAUDE.en.md` on commit.
The hook's sync and validate features work fine without this key.

```powershell
# Current session only
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."

# Permanent (Windows user environment variable)
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "sk-ant-...", "User")
```

### Step 1: Prepare for Learning

If you have the VibeLearn AI_v2.0 folder, you can start right away!

**What you need**:
- ✅ This folder (VibeLearn AI_v2.0/)
- ✅ An AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. - Vibe Coding Tools recommended)
- ✅ A Topic you want to learn and the will to learn

**Optional**:
- Git repository (for version control and sharing your learning process)

---

### Step 2: Create the Topic Starter File

**💡 Recommended Method: Create it by talking to an AI**

If you're unsure how to fill out `topic_starter.md`, use the prompt below with your AI!

```
"I want to learn about [Topic Name]. Can you help me create the topic_starter.md file?
I want to finish in [duration] and achieve [goal].

Please ask me multiple-choice questions (radio buttons/checkboxes) to gather the necessary information according to the VibeLearn AI methodology and create the file with me."
```

**Example**:
```
"I want to learn about Deep Agent technology. Can you help me create the topic_starter.md file?
I want to finish in 2 weeks and actually build an AI Application.

Please ask me multiple-choice questions (radio buttons/checkboxes) to gather the necessary information according to the VibeLearn AI methodology and create the file with me."
```

**What the AI does**:
1.  **Asks structured questions** (You can answer easily with multiple-choice)
    -   What are your learning objectives? (Checkboxes)
    -   What is your level of prior knowledge? (Radio buttons)
    -   What is your learning environment? (Checkboxes)
    -   What is your practice project? (Radio buttons)

2.  **Creates `topic_starter.md` reflecting your answers**
    -   Generates a complete file with all sections filled out.
    -   Structures it according to the VibeLearn AI template format.

3.  **Saves the file**
    -   Saves it as `templates/[YourTopic]_topic_starter.md` (relative to the VibeLearn AI_v2.0 folder).

**Key Advantages**:
- ✅ Quick selection with radio buttons/checkboxes
- ✅ The AI systematically collects the necessary information
- ✅ Generates a complete, ready-to-use file

**How to create it manually**:

```bash
# Copy the topic_starter.md template
cp templates/topic_starter.md [YourTopic]_topic_starter.md

# Example
cp templates/topic_starter.md Docker-Basics_topic_starter.md
```

**Example of a filled-out file**:
```markdown
## 📌 Topic Basic Information
Topic Name: Docker-Basics
Description: Basic concepts and practice of Docker container technology
Learning Purpose: Improve productivity by containerizing the development environment
Estimated Duration: 2 weeks

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the concepts of Docker images and containers
- [ ] Ability to write a Dockerfile
- [ ] Ability to use docker-compose

## 🛠️ Learning Environment
OS: Windows 11
Main Tools:
- Docker Desktop
- VS Code
```

**Key takeaway**: Creating the file in conversation with an AI helps you build a more specific and achievable learning plan!

---

### Step 3: Ask the AI to Create the Topic Folder

Once `topic_starter.md` is complete, use the following prompt with your AI.

**Prompt Template**:
```
"Please look at the `[YourTopic]_topic_starter.md` file and create a Topic folder that follows the VibeLearn AI methodology.

Once done, please guide me on what to do for the next step."
```

**Example**:
```
"Please look at the `DeepAgent_topic_starter.md` file and create a Topic folder that follows the VibeLearn AI methodology.

Once done, please guide me on what to do for the next step."
```

**What the AI does**:
1.  **Automatically creates the Topic folder structure**
    ```
    VibeLearn AI_v2.0/Topics/Deep-Agent/  # Created under the Topics folder
    ├── topic_info.md              # Content from topic_starter is copied here
    ├── vl_prompts/
    │   ├── roadmap_prompt.md      # Prompt injected with Topic info
    │   └── daily_learning_prompt.md
    ├── vl_roadmap/                # Location for the roadmap
    ├── vl_worklog/                # Location for learning logs
    └── vl_materials/              # Reference materials (optional)
    ```

2.  **Guides you to the next step**
    -   Explains how to generate the Roadmap.
    -   Provides the path to the necessary prompt file.
    -   Confirms you are ready to start learning.

---

### Step 4: Generate the Learning Roadmap

Once the Topic folder is created, use the prompt below with your AI.

**Prompt Template**:
```
"Please read the full `Topics/[TopicName]/vl_prompts/roadmap_prompt.md` file and perform only STEP 1, the learning-duration suitability review, first.
Do not create the Roadmap file before my confirmation; wait for my response."
```

**Example**:
```
"Please read the full `Topics/Deep-Agent/vl_prompts/roadmap_prompt.md` file and perform only STEP 1, the learning-duration suitability review, first.
Do not create the Roadmap file before my confirmation; wait for my response."
```

**What the AI does**:
1.  **Reviews the appropriateness of the learning duration** (STEP 1)
    -   Analyzes the Topic's complexity.
    -   Evaluates the adequacy of the duration you entered.
    -   Provides feedback (appropriate/too short/too long).
    -   Waits for user confirmation.

2.  **Generates the roadmap after user confirmation** (STEP 2)
    -   Creates a module-by-module learning plan.
    -   Defines objectives, activities, and DoD for each module.
    -   Creates the `vl_roadmap/YYYYMMDD_RoadMap_[Topic].md` file.

3.  **Guides you to the next step**
    -   Explains how to start your daily learning.
    -   Shows how to use `daily_learning_prompt.md`.

---

### Step 5: Start Your Daily Learning

Once the Roadmap is ready, use this prompt with your AI every day you study.

**Prompt Template**:
```
"Please read the `Topics/[TopicName]/vl_prompts/daily_learning_prompt.md` file and help me with today's learning.

Current Status:
- Roadmap file: Topics/[TopicName]/vl_roadmap/YYYYMMDD_RoadMap_[Topic].md
- Current Module: M[N] - [Module Name]
- Most recent WorkLog: [Filename or 'None - first session']
- Available time: [X hours]"
```

**Example**:
```
"Please read the `Topics/Deep-Agent/vl_prompts/daily_learning_prompt.md` file and help me with today's learning.

Current Status:
- Roadmap file: Topics/Deep-Agent/vl_roadmap/20251228_RoadMap_Deep-Agent.md
- Current Module: M1 - Deep Agent Concepts
- Most recent WorkLog: None - first session
- Available time: 3 hours"
```

**What the AI does**:
1.  **Analyzes the Roadmap and previous WorkLog**
    -   Identifies the current module's goals and DoD.
    -   Checks for any unfinished tasks.

2.  **Creates today's learning plan**
    -   Determines priorities.
    -   Allocates time (with a 20% buffer).
    -   Provides a list of specific activities.

3.  **Starts the learning session after user approval**
    -   Guides you to create the WorkLog file.
    -   Provides real-time learning support.
    -   Answers questions and helps with debugging.

**Duration setting process**:
1.  **You enter your desired duration in `topic_starter.md`**.
    -   e.g., "2 weeks", "1 month", "3 days"

2.  **The AI analyzes the appropriateness before generating the roadmap**.
    -   Assesses Topic complexity (simple/medium/complex).
    -   Considers your prior knowledge level.
    -   Checks the scope of your learning objectives.

3.  **The AI provides feedback**.
    -   ✅ Appropriate: Proceed as is.
    -   ⚠️ Too short: Suggests extending the duration or reducing the scope.
    -   ⚠️ Too long: Suggests shortening the duration or adding advanced content.

4.  **You make the final decision**.
    -   Choose "Proceed as is" / "Adjust duration" / "Adjust scope".

**General duration guide** (for reference):
-   **Simple Topic** (CLI tool, basic concepts): 3-7 days
-   **Medium Complexity** (Framework, library): 2-4 weeks
-   **Complex Topic** (Large-scale system, multiple technologies): 1-3 months

**Key takeaway**: VibeLearn AI is **flexible and adjusts to your schedule**. The AI checks for feasibility, so feel free to set the duration you want!
