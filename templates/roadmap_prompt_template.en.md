# VibeLearn AI Roadmap Generation Prompt

**Version**: 2.0
**Created**: 2025-12-28
**Methodology**: VibeLearn AI

---

## 📌 How to Use

This prompt automatically generates a learning roadmap based on the Topic information entered in `topic_starter.md`.

**Procedure**:
1.  Once the Topic folder is created, this file is copied to `[TopicName]/vl_prompts/`.
2.  The Topic information is already injected.
3.  Provide this entire file to the AI, or if an agent is executing it directly, re-read the generated `vl_prompts/roadmap_prompt.en.md` in full.
4.  AI first performs only STEP 1, the learning-duration suitability review, and waits for user confirmation.
5.  Only after the user confirms the duration/scope, proceed with STEP 2 and STEP 3 to generate the Roadmap and save it to `vl_roadmap/YYYYMMDD_RoadMap_{Topic}.md`.

**Important**: Do not create the Roadmap file before user approval.

## [Step 2] Task to Request from the AI

Based on the injected Topic information above, please generate a learning roadmap that follows the **VibeLearn AI methodology**.

---

### 🔍 STEP 1: Review Appropriateness of Learning Period (Required)

**Must be performed before generating the roadmap:**

Analyze whether the user-entered learning period `{DURATION}` is appropriate for the Topic and provide feedback.

#### Analysis Criteria:
1.  **Assess Topic Complexity**
    -   Simple (e.g., CLI tool, basic concepts): 3-7 days is appropriate.
    -   Intermediate (e.g., framework, library): 2-4 weeks is appropriate.
    -   Complex (e.g., large-scale system, multiple technologies): 1-3 months is appropriate.

2.  **Consider Prior Knowledge**
    -   Sufficient prior knowledge: The period can be shortened.
    -   Lack of prior knowledge: The period needs to be extended.

3.  **Scope of Learning Objectives**
    -   Basic understanding: Short period.
    -   Practical application level: Intermediate period.
    -   Expert level: Long period.

#### Feedback Format:

```markdown
## 📊 Analysis of Learning Period Appropriateness

**User-entered Period**: {DURATION}
**Topic Complexity**: [Simple/Intermediate/Complex]
**Recommended Period**: [X weeks or Y days]

**Analysis Result**:
- ✅ **Appropriate**: The period you entered is suitable for learning this Topic.
- ⚠️ **Too Short**: This Topic generally requires [Recommended Period]. With the current period, you will only learn the core concepts quickly.
- ⚠️ **Too Long**: [Recommended Period] is usually sufficient for this Topic. You can learn at a relaxed pace or cover advanced content.

**Suggested Action**:
- [If appropriate] Proceed as planned.
- [If too short] 1) Recommend extending the period or 2) Reduce the learning scope (basics only).
- [If too long] 1) Shorten the period or 2) Add advanced content.

**User Confirmation Needed**:
Please review the analysis above and choose one of the following:
1.  "Proceed as is" - Continue with the entered period.
2.  "Adjust period" - Change to the recommended period.
3.  "Adjust scope" - Keep the period but adjust the learning scope.
```

**Important**: Pause roadmap generation and wait until the user confirms and makes a final decision.

---

### 🗺️ STEP 2: Roadmap Generation Requirements

After the user finalizes the period, generate the roadmap according to the requirements below.

#### Overall Structure

**Learning Period**: Adjust to match `{Final Confirmed Period}`.
-   3 days or less: 3-5 modules
-   1-2 weeks: 5-7 modules
-   1 month or more: 7-10 modules

**Module Composition Principles**:
-   Each module is an independently completable unit.
-   Difficulty increases gradually (Basics → Intermediate → Advanced).
-   The final module is a Capstone project (integrated practice).

**Naming Conventions**:
-   Modules: `M1`, `M2`, `M3`, ...
-   Output folders: `01-{TopicName}/`, `02-{TopicName}/`, ...

---

#### Required Items for Each Module

Each module must include the following 9 items:

##### 1. Basic Module Information
```markdown
### MX - {Module Name}

**Difficulty**: ⭐/⭐⭐/⭐⭐⭐ (1-3)
**Estimated Time**: X hours
**Output Folder**: `0X-{ModuleName}/`
```

##### 2. Learning Objectives (3-5)
-   Write them to be verifiable ("understand ~" X, "be able to implement ~" O).
-   Use checklist format `- [ ]`.
-   Specific and measurable objectives.

##### 3. Key Concepts
-   Definitions of 3-5 key terms.
-   1-2 sentence explanation for each concept.
-   Mention common points of misunderstanding.

##### 4. Practical Exercises (2-3)
For each exercise:
-   **Exercise Name**: A clear name.
-   **Purpose**: Why this exercise is being done.
-   **Steps**: Specific execution steps (1, 2, 3, ...).
-   **Estimated Time**: X minutes.
-   **Difficulty**: ⭐/⭐⭐/⭐⭐⭐.
-   **Verification Method**: How to confirm success.

##### 5. Outputs
-   Folder structure to be created.
-   List of required files (README.md, code, documents, etc.).
-   Recommended subfolders (`concepts/`, `examples/`, `guides/`, `troubleshooting/`).

##### 6. Definition of Done
5-8 items in a checklist format:
```markdown
- [ ] Achieved all learning objectives.
- [ ] Completed X practical exercises.
- [ ] Successfully executed Y key commands/APIs.
- [ ] Created output folder and wrote README.
- [ ] Completed WorkLog.
- [ ] Completed Daily Retrospective.
```

##### 7. Self-Assessment
Evaluation criteria suitable for the AI era (3-5 questions):
```markdown

```

##### 8. Estimated Time Allocation
```markdown
-   Concept Learning: X min (20-30%)
-   Practice 1: X min
-   Practice 2: X min
-   Documentation: X min
-   **Total**: X hours (including 20% buffer)
```

##### 9. Reference Materials
-   Official documentation link (required).
-   Tutorials/examples (recommended).
-   1-line description for each link.

---

#### Practice Design Principles (Important!)

When designing practical exercises, you **must** adhere to the following principles:

##### 1. Practice First
-   Theory explanation: 20-30%
-   Practice time: 70-80%
-   Repeat the "Explain concept → Immediate practice" pattern.

##### 2. Gradual Complexity
-   Practice 1: Simple (⭐) - "Hello World" level.
-   Practice 2: Intermediate (⭐⭐) - Practical function.
-   Practice 3: Advanced (⭐⭐⭐) - Optional, in-depth.

##### 3. Verifiability
-   Success of all practice can be confirmed by the execution result.
-   e.g., "Log output," "File creation," "Successful API response."
-   Provide clear success criteria.

##### 4. AI-Era Learning Scope
**What humans should know**:
-   Conceptual understanding (what, why, when).
-   Architecture and structure.
-   How to effectively instruct an AI.
-   Basic usage patterns (3-5 core features).

**Memorization not required**:
-   Detailed API parameter lists.
-   All options and flags.
-   Internal implementation details.

##### 5. Output-centric
-   Create a folder for each module (`01-xxx/`, `02-xxx/`).
-   **"Textbook quality"**: At a level that another learner can learn from this alone.
-   **README.md must be included** — it must contain the following:
    -   Module number/title/status/estimated learning time header
    -   All documents in this folder listed **in learning order** with numbers
    -   **Relative path links** for each document (e.g., `[concepts/overview.md](concepts/overview.md)`)
    -   A 1-line description per document (what the learner will learn)
    -   Links to previous/next module
    -   **At a level where someone opening this folder for the first time can follow the learning order just by reading the README**

##### 6. Consider the Environment
-   Use commands appropriate for the OS/tools entered by the user.
-   Windows: PowerShell commands.
-   macOS/Linux: Bash commands.
-   Adjust path notation to match the OS.
